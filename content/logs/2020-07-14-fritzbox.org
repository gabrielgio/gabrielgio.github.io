If you turned off your DHCP server follow these steps to connect to FritzBox
settings.

- Set your computer IP to ~169.254.1.2~ and your mask to ~255.255.0.0~
- Then go to ~169.254.1.1~, login and re-enable the DHCP server.

On gnome turn the wired connection off on again to apply the settings.

Note: why in the hell does FritzBox 7490 require a land-line telephone to be
physically factory reset?
