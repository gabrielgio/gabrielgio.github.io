This was quite simple, I had just to create a simple Gitlab pipeline job and
publish to pages this is done by:

#+BEGIN_SRC
image: clojure:lein-2.7.0

before_script:
  - lein deps

test:
  script:
    - lein test

pages:
  stage: deploy
  script:
    - lein package
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - public
  only:
    - master

#+END_SRC

- before_script :: will download all the dependencies with ~lein deps~.
- test :: is self explanatory.
- pages :: will compile the cljs into js with ~lein package~ and publish it into
  pages.
